Certificate Note

Vocabularies: 

      IaaS - Infrastructure  as a Service
      PaaS - Platform as a Service    ( Superset of IaaS; has something more than IaaS)
      SaaS - Software as a Service    (have a Apps, pay for it: Microsoft 365)
      CLI - Command Line Interface - bash
      VM - virtual machine is a computer file, typically called an image, that behaves like an actual computer
      Power Shell - commonly used for automating the management of systems. It is also used to build, test, and deploy solutions, often in CI/CD environments.
      Cloud Shell - 
      ARM template - ARM: Azure Resource Manager
      scalability - 可扩展性
      
      IaaS provides access to resources such as virtual machines and virtual storage, PaaS provides execution environments, application development, and deployment tools, and SaaS provides software as a service to end-users.
      
Cloud Architecture Models: 

      Private
      Public 
      Hybrid

Resources: compute, networking, storage

Language of Cloud Computing: 
      
      High Availability | Reliability | Scalability | 
      Security | Predictability | Governance | Manageability 

      High Availability - core = always available; X own, add more servers with a click, replace when it fails, use cluster.
      Reliability - fault tolerance, disaster recovery; deploy in multiple locations, no single point of failure
      Scalability - Automatically adjust resources to meet demand. (increase/decrease number of VMs)
                    Horizontal(sacaling out; typical) vs. Vertical Scaling(scaling up)
      Predictability - performance and costs
      Security - full control of the sloud security posture
      Governance - cloud deployments to meet requirement standards
      Manageability - management of cloud resources and how to interact with them.
